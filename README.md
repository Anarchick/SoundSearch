# SoundSearch
 Better than /playsound

I created this small plugin to assist developers in finding the perfect sound for their plugin. (Or anyone who needs to configure a plugin)

This plugin is intended for development servers, NOT PRODUCTION. It is not necessary for players.

**Permission :** soundsearch.use
**Command :** /soundsearch
(Available groups are : ALL, AMBIENT, BLOCK, ITEM, ENTITY, MUSIC, UI)

**Aliases :** I removed the /ss for obvious reason, if you want to create aliases use your commands.yml and write this :
```yaml
aliases:
  ss:
  - soundsearch $1-
```

**Note :** I have not tested but I suppose this plugin works with almost all mc versions.
